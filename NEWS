Version 0.4.3
- Fix for print method.
- Removing class and function 'modfun'

Version 0.4.2

- CRAN release

Version 0.2.4

waiting for a runtime error: fail early!

Version 0.2.3
- modules can now distinguish between situations in which they are constructed
inside a package, inside another module (nested module), or inside a script.
This behaviour is implemented in 'autoTopEncl' and can be overridden. This
behaviour defines the search path of a module.

consistent with 'import'. 'reInit' can be used to trigger re-initialization of
module.

- A 'module' now has an attribute 'moduleConst' which knows how to initialize a
  module and contains sufficient information for that process.
- New function 'expose' to inherit a whole module.
